You are building a full SaaS version of "CloudBiz Pro" â€“ a professional Business Management System.

ðŸ”¹ Core Requirements:
1. Multi-Tenant Support:
   - Each business/company should have its own workspace, database schema isolation, and admin.
   - Tenant-based authentication: one admin per company can create/manage users under their company only.
   - Data separation so one company cannot access another's data.

2. Authentication & Authorization:
   - Admin signup & login for businesses (email + password).
   - Role-based access: Admin, Manager, Employee.
   - Secure session management with JWT.

3. Payments & Subscription (Manual Control):
   - No Stripe integration required.
   - Manual billing will be handled outside the system.
   - Add "Account Status" field (active/inactive) in each company profile.
   - Only Super Admin (SaaS Owner) can toggle company status.
   - If a company is set to "inactive", their users can still log in but will only see a "Suspended / Contact Admin" screen instead of features.
   - When active, all features are accessible again.

4. Features for Each Company:
   - Inventory management (products, stock levels, alerts).
   - Customer management (CRM features).
   - Sales & invoicing system.
   - Reports & Analytics (charts, export PDF/Excel).
   - Notifications (low stock, new sale, payment reminders).
   - Multi-language support (English, Urdu, Arabic) with i18n.

5. PWA + Mobile Ready:
   - Progressive Web App support (installable on desktop/mobile).
   - Push notifications enabled.
   - Responsive, modern UI with React + TailwindCSS.

6. Admin Super-Panel (SaaS Owner):
   - Manage all companies/tenants.
   - View active/inactive companies and system stats.
   - Manually activate/deactivate any company depending on their payment.
   - System-wide announcements.
   - Total revenue input field (manual update).

7. Tech Stack:
   - Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
   - Backend: Node.js (Express.js or NestJS)
   - Database: PostgreSQL (Neon/Postgres with multi-tenant design)
   - Auth: JWT + bcrypt for passwords
   - Deployment: Replit + Neon PostgreSQL

8. Quality Standards:
   - Full CRUD for all modules.
   - Fully functional SaaS flow (signup â†’ workspace â†’ dashboard â†’ admin control).
   - Clean UI, easy UX for both admins and users.
   - Secure and scalable architecture.
   - Demo accounts auto-seeded for testing.
